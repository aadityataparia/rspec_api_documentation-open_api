# RspecApiDocumentation::OpenApi

Adds `open_api_json` and `open_api_yaml` output format to `rspec_api_documentation`.
This gem is developed to be used at [Cookpad](https://github.com/cookpad/) to create openAPI spec using [`rspec_api_documentation`](https://github.com/zipmark/rspec_api_documentation) gem.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rspec_api_documentation-open_api', '~>0.2.2'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself by:

    $ gem install rspec_api_documentation-open_api

## Usage

in *spec/spec_helper.rb* add
```rb
RspecApiDocumentation.configure do |config|
  config.format = :open_api_json # for json file
end
```
or
```rb
RspecApiDocumentation.configure do |config|
  config.format = :open_api_yaml # for yaml file
end
```

You can change other default configuration using

  config.open_api = {
    "info": {
      "version" => "1.0.0",
      "title" => "Open API",

      }
    },

      {
        "url" => "http://localhost:{port}",

        "variables" => {
          "port" => {
            "default" => "3000"

      }
    ]
  }
end
```
